        'content': ''' The global electronic music community lost another giant this week in the death of Detroit's Kelli Hand (K.Hand).  Known as the first lady of Detroit Techno - Hand was a bold female voice in a world that (at her start in 1990) was nearly exclusively male and rife with sexism.  Not only was she a highly in demand and well regarded DJ but her prolific record label Acacia Records [https://www.discogs.com/label/2458-Acacia-Records] featured dozens of EPs of solo material as well as early works by Claude Young and deep house pioneers Chris Brann/Wamdue Kids.  Hand was presented with a Spirit of Detroit Award in 2016 along with several other electronic musicians including Jeff Mills, Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson. In July 2017, Hand was named a First Lady of Detroit and honored by the city with a Testimonial Resolution certificate acknowledging her substantial contributions to techno and dance music.
My most resiliant memory of Kelli was seeing her rock the decks in 1998 with supreme confidance and style alongside some of the best of the best in techno in the 90's.  Her remixes, with Claude Young, of an early hit "Get Ready for the Darkness" was one of the first tracks i heard at a rave and subsequently searched for a few years before securing a copy at the original Submerge/Somewhere in Detroit store.  Her spirit lives on through the art she left us and the people she touched.  RIP ''',

        'content': '''What can be said about legenedary Chicago DJ and Producer paul Johnson that hasn't been said...
Many spoke about his legendary catalog of classic releases [https://www.discogs.com/artist/866-Paul-Johnson] ranging from helping to jumpstart a movement of disco infused house on Cajual, Releif and Peacefrog Records to minimal bangers on Chicago Juke Label Dance Mania favored by house and techno djs alike in the nineties.  This work earned him the first mention on Daft Punks seminal respect callout track "Teachers".  He was also known as a dancers and DJs DJ alike, beloved by dancefloors for a signature groove and by his DJ peers for incredible technical prowess and track selection ability.  These abilities made him a sureshot staple on rave and festival lineups from 1994 to 2020.
For me and, i imagine, many who had the pleasure to work and play with PJ what I will remember most is his can do spirit, infectious smile and commitment to beautifying the world around him through music and camradery.   Legendary Producer/DJ who made his own way.  PJ you are in our hearts as the music was in you...''',
